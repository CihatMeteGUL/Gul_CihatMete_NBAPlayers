# Gul_CihatMete_NBAPlayers
I realized that there is not a system on Github that only the people I share the link can see. 
I decided to open a new account (but I'm not sure that it is a good idea to open a new account with my full name & surname) to avoid any possibility of cheating.

I got the "Invalid VCS root mapping" warning in Android Studio because I backed up on GitHub while doing the project, and then tried to delete them, and installed the last version. But it does not affect the running of the program. I also included the APK file: "Gul_CihatMete_NBAPlayers.apk". My background colours change according to the injury status of the player. I added everything wanted from me.

Thanks for everything you have taught so far, it was an enjoyable and instructive lesson. I wish you healthy days.
